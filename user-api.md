Creating and Modify Users for Consumer Directed Exchange
========================================================

This document describes how to create and modify users in VerifyMyIdentity. VerifyMyIdentity is an open-source standards-focused certified Open ID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider. 

The following examples create "Member" accounts for purposes of Consumer Directed Exchange (CDeX). Member is often an synonym for "Patient", "Conumser", "Client", and "Community Member".  The API calls shown here are to be used by trusted 3rd party applications.

The field names and structure of the HTTP request\response  bodies mirror and build upon Open ID Connect (OIDC) https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html and the iGov Profile for OpenID Connect https://openid.net/specs/openid-igov-openid-connect-1_0-02.html.

Authorization to the API is controlled through OAuth2.



Create a User Example #1: Minimal
==============================

The following example illustrates a bare rminimum request necessary to create a new user for purposes of Consumer Directed Exchange) 

* HTTP Method: POST 
* Request Body: application/json
* Response Body: application/json
* Endpoint:https://alpha.verifymyidentity.com/api/v1/user/
* Authorization: OAuth2 Bearer Token

Discussion
----------
The fields `gender` and `birthdate` are not strictly required to create an account but are necessary to enable patient-linking and matching to the individual's health records.   While not required a `password` parameter may also be given in this request.  If the password is not set, the user will need to set their own password through some alternative workflow.  In this example, there are no claims being made about the user's identity assurance level (IAL), therefore the resulting IAL is `1` (lowest trust).  In the next Enriched Example section we will create a more robust user from the start.


Request Body
------------

    {
    "preferred_username": "james",
    "given_name": "James",
    "family_name": "Kirk",
    "gender": "male",
    "birthdate": "1952-01-03"
    }




Successful Request Response
---------------------------

A successful response `HTTP 200` will return a similar structure to what was sent.:


    {
    "iss": "https://alpha.verifymyidentity.com",
    "subject": "123456789012345",  
    "username": "james",   
    "given_name": "James",
    "family_name": "Kirk",
    "gender": "male",
    "birthdate": "1952-01-03",
    "ial": 1,
    "id_assursance" : [],
    "document" : [],
    "address": []
    }

Modify a User's Date of Birth
------------------------------

* HTTP Method: POST or PUT
* Request Body: application/json
* Response Body: application/json
* Endpoint: https://alpha.verifymyidentity.com/api/v1/user/[sub]
* Authorization: OAuth2 Bearer Token


Request Endpoint: HTTP PUT /api/v1/user/123456789012345

Request Body:
-------------


    {
    "birthdate": "2233-03-22"
    }



Successful Response
-------------------

Response code is `200`. 


    {

    }



Adding\Modify Identity Assurance Level Evidence
-----------------------------------------------

* HTTP Method: `POST` (tp create) amd `PUT` (to Modify)
* Request Body: application/json
* Response Body: application/json
* Endpoint:https://alpha.verifymyidentity.com/api/v1/user/[sub]
* Authorization: OAuth2 Bearer Token

Adding a record of identity verification is how the IAL is calculated.  The `sub` is provided  as the identifier for the user record. 
In most cases, the goal is to move a user's account from level `1` to level `2` for an extended period of time. The identity assurance level (IAL) claim contains:

* A description of the evidence
* A code classifying the evidence. Codes include `ONE-SUPERIOR-OR-STRONG+`,`ONE-STRONG-TWO-FAIR`,`TWO-STRONG`,  `TRUSTED-REFEREE-VOUCH`, and `KBA`. See Nist SP 800-63-3 for details.
* The subject identifier of the person acting as a trusted agent (if applicable).
* The date of the identity verification check.

Adding\Modifying Identifiers
----------------------------

* HTTP Method: `POST` (to create) `PUT` (to update)
* Request Body: application/json
* Response Body: application/json
* Endpoint:https://alpha.verifymyidentity.com/api/v1/user/[sub]/identifier/
* Authorization: OAuth2 Bearer Token

Identifiers are for adding master patient indexes and other types of pointers to individuals.  Examples include, a Medicaid ID number, a driver's license numbers, and a patient ID to a particular online resource (e.g. FHIR)aa record of identity verification is how the IAL is calculated.  The `sub` is provided  as the identifer for the user record. 
In most cases, the goal is to move a user's account from level `1` to level `2` for an extended period of time.

In the folowing example, two patient ID's to consumer facing API's are added to the user's record.
The `software_id` field is used as the primary key to uniquely identify a given system. The `issuer` is a string describing the system.  The `type` identifies the type of the data contained in `nu,`  The `endpoint'` is the actual URL for the FHIR Resource server.  The `num` is the actual FHIR patient identier. Despit its name, it need not be a number.
